## Introduction

In this case study, we will work with a PostgreSQL database to analyze various aspects of the data using SQL queries. The database contains tables representing products, customers, orders, and other relevant information. We will perform different queries to answer specific questions and gain insights from the data.

## Questions

The following questions will be addressed in this case study:

1. Which product has the highest price? Only return a single row.
2. Which customer has made the most orders?
3. Whatâ€™s the total revenue per product?
4. Find the day with the highest revenue.
5. Find the first order (by date) for each customer.
6. Find the top 3 customers who have ordered the most distinct products.
7. Which product has been bought the least in terms of quantity?
8. What is the median order total?
9. For each order, determine if it was 'Expensive' (total over 300), 'Affordable' (total over 100), or 'Cheap'.
10. Find customers who have ordered the product with the highest price.

## Usage

To run the SQL queries and solve the case study questions, follow these steps:

1. Install PostgreSQL: [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
2. Create a new database and connect to it using a PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin, psql).
3. Execute the SQL queries provided in the case study against the connected database.
4. Review the query results to find the answers to the case study questions.

## Database Structure

Please provide the database schema and table structures for your dataset. Include the necessary tables and their respective columns to execute the SQL queries. You can describe the structure of each table and any important relationships between them.

## Sample Data

Please provide some sample data for the tables in your database. This will help in understanding the dataset and running the queries effectively. You can include a few rows of data for each table, ensuring that it covers the required columns for the SQL queries.
